## Welcome to Project DARC Organization! ðŸ‘‹

Greetings from DARC Team! ðŸŒž We're your friendly neighborhood tech geeks building the future of decentralized organization with Project DARC (Decentralized Autonomous Regulated Corporation).

### About Us

At Project DARC, our mission is to create a fully on-chain decentralized crypto company/fund, uniquely regulated by plugins. Imagine a crypto entity governed by smart contracts that can adapt to changing regulations seamlessly.

### By-law Script

Our secret sauce? By-law Script, the official programming language that powers the DARC protocol. It not only operates your DARC but also serves as the language for designing plugins, the laws, rules, and contracts that shape our decentralized ecosystem.

### Join Us!

Excited about the decentralized future? So are we! We're currently in the early stages of this groundbreaking project and are on the lookout for passionate contributors to join our mission. Whether you're a coding wizard or just curious about the crypto space, there's a place for you in Project DARC.
