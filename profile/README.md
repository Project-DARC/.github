## Hi there 👋

This is the official GitHub organization for the Project DARC(Decentralized Autonomous Regulated Corporation). 

We are building a fully on-chain decentralized crypto company/fund that is regulated by plugins.

By-law Script is the official programming language that operate your DARC protocol and design the plugins as the laws/rules/contracts.

We are currently in the early stage of the project, and we are looking for contributors to join us.
